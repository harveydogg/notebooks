        "\n",
        "This analysis was motivated by a specific practical problem. We begin by explaining what this analysis is <i>for</i>, and why it was deemed <i>necessary</i>.\n",
        "\n",
        "<u>What For</u>:<br>\n",
        "Suppose we have a jar known to contain a thousand marbles, each red or blue, and would like to know their proportion. However, for practical reasons we are unable to examine all of them, so we need to select a random sample and use this to estimate. Moreover — again, for practical reasons — our goal is to examine as few marbles as possible, while still achieving an estimate we deem adequate. (Note: The original problem context was software evaluation, but marbles are easier to visualize.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Naturally there will be a trade-off between \"as few as possible\" and \"adequate estimate.\" And depending on the actual context, the way these goals are balanced may involve qualitative considerations best handled on a case-by-case basis. So our aim here is not final analysis; we merely seek to quantify that trade-off. \n",
        "\n",
        "<u>Why Necessary</u>:<br>\n",
        "At first glance, our marble problem sounds like a standard Stats 101 example. But it has two features that, together, make it non-standard:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Sample selection is done without replacement.\n",
        "2. The population $(N = 1,000)$ is small.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically our problem is most reminiscent of the binomial distribution, which characterizes repeat trials of an experiment also having exactly two possible outcomes. (For example, flipping a coin multiple times.) However, in binomial distributions the trials are <i>independent</i>, meaning the probabilities of the two outcomes remain constant from one trial to the next. Our problem does not have that feature. As we draw our sample, each individual is removed from the population, which means that each successive selection is drawn from a slightly altered population. (Think poker hands: the deck composition changes as each card is dealt.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, in practice this feature of the binomial distribution does not prevent its widespread applicablity to situations involving random sampling. (For example, opinion polls.) Provided the population is enormous relative to the sample, even the first and final selections can be treated as coming from the \"same\" population. (For reference: <a href=\"https://www.janda.org/c10/Lectures/topic05/GallupFAQ.htm#size\" target=\"_blank\">Gallup polls</a> typically sample 1,000 from a population of 187 million.) And given the mathematical cleanliness of the binomial distribution, this simplifying assumption is usually desirable.\n",
        "\n",
        "But this is where (2) comes in. If the population is only, say, between a few hundred and a few thousand, then one might need to sample between 20% and 50% of the population to achieve a satisfactory estimate. In such cases, clearly we can't just assume the composition of the population stays constant throughout the process of selection. So we can't use the binomial distribution as an approximation. (Well, perhaps we can? But if so, providing a <i>proof</i> that we can would be more challenging than just doing the exact calculations. So for us it wouldn't be a <i>simplifying</i> assumption.)"

        "Although we shall stick to our marbles, the following analysis and algorithms can be applied to a wide range of cases. However, there is one crucial restriction:\n",
        "\n",
        "- <i>The variable must be binary.</i>\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, our variable is color and it has two possible values: every marble in the population is either red or blue, but not both. Of course, our analysis could be extended to categorical variables having more than two values, provided the number of categories is finite. But we do not attempt that extension here; all formulas and algorithms apply exlusively to the case of binary variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "We should also note that, although we motivated this analysis by citing small population size, this is not a requirement. In fact, no matter how large the population, our combinatorial approach produces the exact calculations for which the binomial distribution provides approximation. The downside of all that brute force counting is unscalability. The $\\Theta$ function (our main result) computes in seconds on a 2020 MacBook for N = 1,000; in minutes for N = 2,500; in hours for N = 10,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "We proceed in two steps. In Part 1, we assume we already know the composition of the jar (i.e. population) and use this to calculate the probability of collecting various random samples. This foundation will help us tackle our motivating problem in Part 2, where we estimate the (unknown) composition of the jar, based on a random sample we have already collected."

Thus, we can substitute $ R = N - B $ and $ r = s - b $ to produce a more efficient formulation of the desired probability, which for now we represent as a function of $b$ (i.e., treating $N$, $B$, and $s$ as givens):\n",
